No one would have believed that in the last years of the nineteenth century that
human affairs were being watched from the timeless wheels of space. No even
dreamed we were being scrutinized as someone with a microscope studies creatures
that swam and multiply in a drop of water. Few men even considered the
possibility of life in other planets, and yet, across the gulf of space, minds
immeasurably superior to ours guided this earth with envious eyes, slowly and
surely, they drew their plans against us.
